1. a) Read the text in alice.txt. Implement the NLP processing steps we
did in class to extract a 'good' set of tokens. Apply the basic
processing steps are: - Tokenize the text into sentences and then words.
- Extract POS tags for each token. - Convert all tokens to lower case. -
Stem the terms - eliminate all stop words.

   b) Implement a few filtering rules to eliminate any remaining not
   useful tokens (those containing punctuation marks and others
   depending on your data set).

   c) Find the frequency of each token. Order tokens by their
   frequencies. List the 5 most frequent tokens and 5 least frequent
   tokens.

   d) Describe any problems/incorrect terms did you find with this type
   of processing.

	To read the file line by line use the example in read_alice_file.py


2. Install the spell checker pyenchant and check it for a number of
mispelled words and a short text with misspelled words (one sentence).
Does it work correctly? In which cases it did not work correctly?

3. Think about a retrieval and text analysis application and a data set
that you would like to use. Describe it in a few sentences.
