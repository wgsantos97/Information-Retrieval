HW 1 Report
1d)
The processing yielded good results. As expected, 'the' appeared in the top 5. There are still
a few nuances that need to be addressed to refine this process. For one, verbs have not been simplified
to their base form, ignoring tense. So 'remember', 'remembered', and 'remembering' will appear as three different
entries. Unsure how to best address this issue. The results are printed below and the source code can be found in hw1.py.
Please edit line 12 of hw1.py if a different text file needs to be parsed.

I have very little knowledge with regards to retrieval and text analysis applications. The most exposure I have
relates to Pandas, and that is in a very limited capacity. My interest in information retrieval/analysis would be in the scope
of profiling users through their search history. So given a set of terms that they inputed, use that information to infer aspects
about the target user.
