The code is programmed to generate txt files and folders with the data gathered from reuters.
It mainly used the catergory "acq". As such, there were 800+ results. That number
was then reduced to 150. After processing the data, the results were outputted into the following:
- 2a Data (Folder)
    globalFreq.txt
    invertedIdx.txt
- 2b Data (Folder)
    TF_IDF Similarity Results.txt
    Jaccard Similarity Results.txt
- statistics.txt

The following three queries run were written to imitate a search by a user who wanted to determine
how lucrative banking is. As such, each query got more and more specific:
- "banking"
- "financial bank pay"
- "financial analyst profitable"

The comparisons used were the TF_IDF and Jaccard Similarities. TF_IDF was harder to implement, but the
Jaccard was relatively straightforward. Given a list of words from both the query and the target doc,
turn them into sets, s1 and s2 respectively, and divide their intersection by their union.

After running the code, the Jaccard Similarity seems to be far less precise 
at identifying texts that are similar based on key words. At the very least,
the pool of results is smaller than when using the TF_IDF Similarity.
