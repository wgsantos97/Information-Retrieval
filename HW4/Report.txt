10.8
Q: Give a suggestion on how to improve a ranking function for web search to take in additional page 
    information such as the title field or page layout.
A: This new ranking funtion can use the given queries to match content from inside the page and determine
    similarities. For example, a ranking function can calculate the probability of a certain page being useful
    by running a comparison between the given query and the page title.

10.10
Q: If we add a new page to the web, what happens to other existing PageRank scores? Explain.
A: It depends. Do the existing pages link to this new page? How many of them do? Which pages does this new one link to?
    If the pages that link to the new one are very important, then this one will likely be ranked similarly.

10.12
Q: Give a query where a high-scoring authority page could be a desired document and a query with a 
    high-scoring hub page could be a desired document.
A: Authority Page Query --> "Game of Thrones Season 4 Synposis" // User searches for something very specific.
    Hub Page Query --> "Star Wars Wiki" // User searches for a literal hub of information, probably for research. Very general.
