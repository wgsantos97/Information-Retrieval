Comment:
Overall, the results were surprisingly well-clustered. The results were far more accurate compared to the LM and tf-idf methods.
However, that could also be due to the fact that I was inexperienced in how I implemented those algorithms. By now, I have become
much better at programming in Python and also had help from the professor in implementing the Dirichlet and Jelinek Mercer 
algorithms. At any rate, the Jelinek seemed to have the best precision overall. Granted, I was somewhat forgiving in how I
graded their relevance to my search queries, but still, it gave better results.

For more information regarding the precisions, please refer to the "JM_Precisions.txt" and "DP_Precisions.txt".
For details on the data generated, please run the "hw3.py" code and it will generate a "3a Data" with the global frequency and
inverted index as well as "3b Data" with the rankings for all the queries alongside the given smoothing values.
