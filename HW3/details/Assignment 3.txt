Assignment 3 - IR Language Models

For the set of documents you used in Assignment 2, implement the language model
with:
 a) Jeliner Mercer (JM) linear interpolation smoothing - pick three
different values of lambda. 
b) Dirichlet prior smoothing  - pick three
difference values for mu

Implement the algorithm described in the slides (last two slides). Same nlp
processing as in Assignment 2.

Rank the documents for the same queries in Assignment 2 and compute the precision for 
each smoothing method and parameter value. Precision is # of relevant doc from the first
5 docs/5. 

Compare the results between the two smoothing methods and the tf-idf results from 
Assignment 2. 

Turn in (hard-copy and blackboard - no zip files, just individual files)

 1. Code, queries,  sample ranked results. 
 2. Precision results for each of the queries and parameter values. 
 3. Comment on the results you got and comparison between different LM and td-idf methods.
